<h2 style="margin: 80px 0px 10px;"></h2>

I am a student in the [Mathematics, Mechanics and Informatics Faculty](http://mim.hus.vnu.edu.vn/en) at the [Hanoi University of Science](https://hus.vnu.edu.vn/).

My research lies at the intersection of **computer vision** and **machine learning** -- with a special focus on building intelligent visual systems that are continual and data-efficient. My research interests include **continual learning**, **few-shot learning**, **semi-supervised learning**, **generative models**, **3D geometry models**, and **medical imaging**.

My biography is [here]#(./biography/).

<strong style="color:#e74d3c; font-weight:600"><strong style="color:#e74d3c; font-weight:600">I am actively looking for self-motivated Ph.D. students with interests in computer vision and machine learning. If you are interested, please send me an email. You may see details [here](./openings/).</strong>
